## Automated fun emails from Chico (my dog)!

This was a script to automatically send emails to my friends, with links to funny tiktoks (with a % chance to get rick-rolled), as well as pictures of Chico and my other dog Ella.  

 Started as an idea to make a to-do bot for my own productivity, ended up writing emails pretending to be my dog, you're as confused as I am... :man_shrugging:
